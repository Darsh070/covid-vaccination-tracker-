# covid-vaccination-tracker-

Real time vaccination app for IN, it is always going to update next day @9:15am

This app has information about vaccination details , and we are trying to predict total individuals which can be vaccinated through parameters like total no.of sites and total no.of sessions in particular area,state,and region .


Here is our app link and note that the values that you are giving should be relevant because variables minimum value is in  millions so don't put values like 
no.of sites = 100 , no.of sessions = 600 because our model is trained with large values 


eg :
consider case of Maharashtra
total no.of sites(sites are place in which vaccination is provided) = 3407
total no.of session conducted ( sum of all sessions conducted in each site of that particular region) = 904833
 
     Note : -  total no.of session conducted will be larger then total no.of sites
Enjoy :)
